The FWI System provides a comprehensive background on how weather conditions influence forest fires, with detailed information available at FWI System. Similarly, the FBP System offers insights into fire behavior predictions, with more details accessible at FBP System. Together, these systems provide crucial data for analyzing and predicting forest fire behavior in Canada. \n",
