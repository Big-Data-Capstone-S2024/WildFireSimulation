### **BDM-3035 Big Data Capstone Project**<br/>

#### *Project Objective*
Wildfires significantly threaten various provinces in Canada, causing extensive damage to property, ecosystems, and human lives. Climate change and other factors have increased the frequency and intensity of these fires, necessitating more accurate and timely prediction and management strategies. Current methods often fall short, underscoring the need for advanced technological solutions. <br/>
This project aims to improve wildfire prediction and management by leveraging generative AI technologies. Recent wildfires in the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia have highlighted the urgent need for innovative solutions, with AI playing a key role in more effective forest fire management. Our multidisciplinary team is dedicated to developing a prediction system to enhance fire risk assessment, emergency response planning, resource allocation, and public awareness. Utilizing advanced AI techniques, we seek to safeguard communities and natural resources in wildfire-prone areas.
